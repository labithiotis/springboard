# Springboard Server

# Running Locally

There's a small bash helper script to start the service locally.

Start service dependencies like mongodb or other apis

```bash
./run dependencies
```

Then run the start script which starts the project with nodemon (which automatic restarts application on code changes)

```bash
./run start
```
